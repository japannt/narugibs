<h3 align="center">naruGibs, a fast-paced railgun focused gamemode for Garry's Mod</h3>
<hr />
<p>It's mostly unfinished, and a little rough around the edges but it's a start.</p>
<p>It is a work in progress, and I'm not sure if it will ever be finished, but hey if I find the motivation then, maybe I guess.</p>
<hr />
<1>How to play:</h>
<p>When the game starts, the only weapon you have is a railgun. You can shoot it like any other gun.</p>
<p>There's a dash ability, that allows you to... dash, I can't make it sound epic enough to put in the description, but it's pretty cool.</p>
<br>
<p>To win a game, you must get to the frag limit. (That can be set via the <code>ng_frags</code> convar.)</p>
<p>Movement isn't really forgiving, let me explain:</p>
<p>You can't really control yourself while dashing, you're stuck how you launched yourself, until you land. <strong>Unless</strong> you frag someone while in mid air, then you can dash again.</p>
<p>And obviously you can't dash while in mid air, but you can dash again after landing.</p>
