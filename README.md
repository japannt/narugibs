<h3 align="center">naruGibs, a fast-paced railgun focused gamemode for Garry's Mod</h3>
<hr />
<p>It's kinda finished, and a little rough around the edges but it's a start.</p>
<p>It is a work in progress, and I'm not sure if it will ever be finished, but hey if I find the motivation then, maybe I guess.</p>
<hr />
<h3>How to install:</h3>
<p>Grab the code from the funny green button above</p>
<p>after the zip finishes downloading, open your GMod folder and paste the entire folder into the gamemodes folder.<br><code>garrysmod/garrysmod/gamemodes</code></p>
<p>Restart GMod and you should be good to go!</p>
